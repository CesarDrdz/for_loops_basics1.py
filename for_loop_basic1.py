# Rules
# 1 Print all integers from 0 to 150.
# 2 Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000
# 3 Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".
# 4 Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.
# 5 Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.
# # # Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)


# 1
# for x in range(0, 151,):
    # print(x)

# 2
# for x in range(5, 1000, 5):
    # print(x)

# 3
# for x in range(0, 100,):
#   print(x)
#   if val =/ "5"
#   print (Coding)
#   elif val =/ 10 
#   print (Coding Dojo)
# 

# 4 Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum
# for x in range(0, 500000):
    # print (sum)
# 

# 5 Count back by 4 starting at 2018
# for x in range(2018, 0, -4):
    # print(x)
# 

# 6 Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# lowNum = "6"
# highNum = "30"
# mult = "2"
# for x in range (5 , 31 , *2):
    # print (x)
